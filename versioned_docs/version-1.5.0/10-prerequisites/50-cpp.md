# C++

All software that is intended to run onboard a UAV is preffered to be written in C++.
Although ROS/ROS2 natively supports also Python, well-written C++ provides significantly better performance (computational resources are scarce onboard a UAV) and compile-time sanity checking (the code is much less likely to crash during runtime mid-flight).
Therefore we recommend to learn C++ and get used to programming with it.

* A C++ mini-tutorial (**suggested for everyone**): [ctu-mrs.github.io/docs/software/cpp](https://ctu-mrs.github.io/docs/software/cpp)
* The C++ standard library already implements a lot of tools and classes: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)
* If you want to go much deeper into C++, I recommend the excellent [C++ Weekly by Jason Turner series](https://www.youtube.com/user/lefticus1)
* For interesting in-depth videos about the development of the C++ language, see [CppCon presentations](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon)
