### Linux and Robotics: Why Use Linux?

Linux is the operating system of choice for robotics and scripting due to its flexibility, control, and extensive ecosystem. Here's why it stands out:

---

#### Why Use Linux in Robotics?

1. **Real-Time Control**:
   Linux provides robust tools and kernel modifications (e.g., PREEMPT_RT) for real-time operation, critical for robotics.

2. **Open Source**:
   Linux's open-source nature allows developers to modify and tailor the operating system for specific robotic applications.

3. **Networking and Compatibility**:
   Linux excels in networking and integrates seamlessly with hardware and communication protocols widely used in robotics.

#### Why Is Linux Good for Scripting?

- **Powerful Shell Tools**:
  Linux provides powerful scripting environments like Bash, allowing automation of repetitive tasks and fine-grained system control.

- **Language Support**:
  It natively supports popular programming languages like Python, C++, and Shell scripting, commonly used in robotics development.

- **Ease of Customization**:
  Scripts can directly interact with the OS, allowing custom configurations and workflows.

#### Why Do We Use Ubuntu?

Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distributions in robotics because:

- **Native ROS Support**:
  Ubuntu is the recommended OS for the Robot Operating System (ROS), with packages and tools optimized for it.

- **Ease of Use**:
  Ubuntu offers a beginner-friendly interface and extensive documentation, making it accessible for new users.

- **Community Support**:
  A large and active user base ensures quick solutions to problems and plenty of learning resources.
