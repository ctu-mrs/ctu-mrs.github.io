# Run Simulation Faster than Real-time

Simulation In The Loop (SITL) can be run faster or slower than real-time.

The speed factor is set using the environment variable PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR.
For example, to run the simulation at 2 times the real-time speed put the following command to your `session.yml` into `pre_window` part, or into `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=2
```

To run at half real-time:

```bash
export PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=0.5
```

### Example of setting `session.yml` with PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=2
```yml
name: simulation
root: ./
startup_window: status
pre_window: export UAV_NAME=uav1; export RUN_TYPE=simulation; export UAV_TYPE=t650; export WORLD_NAME=simulation; export PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR=2
windows:
...
```

For more detail description see [px4 website](https://dev.px4.io/v1.10/en/simulation/#simulation_speed).

# Run Simulation SLOWER than Real-time

Running simulation slower using the `PX4_SIM_SPEED_FACTOR` variable causes problems when simulating multiple UAVs.
To slow down the simulation instead change the max real-time update rate of Gazebo some time after the start of the simulation, i.e., include this in your `session.yml` file to slow down the simulation to 0.5 real-time factor:
```yml
  - gz_rate:
      layout: tiled
      panes:
        - waitForOdometry; sleep 5; gz physics -u 125
```
`gz physics -u 250` corresponds to real-time factor `1.0`, reduce the update rate accordingly to reach your desired real-time factor.
