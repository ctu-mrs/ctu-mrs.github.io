| The MRS UAV System 1.5 is being released and this page needs updating. Please, keep in mind that the information on this page might not be valid. |

# Prerequsities

1. The [ROS Noetic](http://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) installed.
2. The [MRS UAV System](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_system) installed.
3. The [MRS UAV Gazebo Simulation](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_gazebo_simulation) installed.
4. Place `source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh` in your `.bashrc` file (or the `rc` file of your shell).

# Starting the simulation

Running the simulation consists of several steps, which are **automated** using a **tmuxinator** script.
Examples of tmuxinator files can be found in the **tmux** folder within the [mrs_uav_gazebo_simulation](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_gazebo_simulation) package.
With the system installed, you can find them (and then copy them elsewhere) by running
```bash
roscd mrs_uav_gazebo_simulation/tmux
```
Each folder contains a different simulation scenario.

The simlation scenario will be started by calling the `start.sh` script within its folder.
This will call the `tmuxinator` utility that uses the prescription in the `session.yml` file to spawn a `tmux` session.
```bash
roscd mrs_uav_gazebo_simulation/tmux/one_drone
./start.sh
```

You should be presented with the windows of the "Gazebo simulator" and the "Rviz" upon starting the session.

# Stopping the simulation

You have two options:

a) Run the `./kill.sh` script.
b) Hit the _killing shortcut_: `ctrl+a k` (`ctrl+a` and then `k`). A menu will appear in which you confirm the selection.

# Configuring the UAV

The UAVs are **not** part of the simulation world, but are _spawned_ dynamically after the world has started.
The _spawning_ is handler by a ROS node `mrs_drone_spawner` that can introduce new UAVs into the world based on user's command.
The properties of the drones are defined within the `session.yml` on the line
```yaml
- waitForGazebo; rosservice call /mrs_drone_spawner/spawn "1 $UAV_TYPE --enable-rangefinder --enable-ground-truth"
```
See the [drone spawner documentation page](./drone_spawner.md) for details on how to modify the drone configurations.
