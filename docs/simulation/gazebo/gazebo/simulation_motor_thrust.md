# Gazebo Motor parameters

* **Pixhawk** controller output is shaped via function

    `output = (original_output + input_offset) * input_scaling + zero_position_armed`
  
  in **gazebo_mavlink_interface.cpp**. The parameters are loaded from **component_snippets.xacro** from the **rotor** block:
  
  ```xml
  <channel name="rotor2">
    <input_index>1</input_index>
    <input_offset>0</input_offset>
    <input_scaling>1</input_scaling>
    <zero_position_disarmed>0</zero_position_disarmed>
    <zero_position_armed>0.15</zero_position_armed>
    <joint_control_type>velocity</joint_control_type>
  </channel>
  ```
  
  The *original_output* is scaled from 0 to 1.
  The new output has *zero_position_armed* added, which offsets the signal up and emulates the "minimal rotor speed" set in PixHawk.
  
* **Gazebo** receives the signals from PixHawk ([0, 1])
  * A simulated rotor speed (rad/s) is generated by dividing the signal by the *rotor_velocity_slowdown_sim* constant
    * that is the speed of the actual model in gazebo 
  * A thrust [N] is generated from the signal (NOT the simulated rotor speed) by the function
    `thrust = motor_constant * signal^2`
  * the parameters are in the **.xacro** file 

  ```xml
  <xacro:property name="rotor_velocity_slowdown_sim" value="0.0159236" />
  <xacro:property name="motor_constant" value="8.3" /> <!-- [kg.m/s^2] -->
  ```
  
  * *rotor_velocity_slowdown_sim* is set so the max velocity is 10 revolutions per second
