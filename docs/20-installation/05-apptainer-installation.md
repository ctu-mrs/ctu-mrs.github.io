# Apptainer

[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) is an open-source **containerization** software designed specifically for high-performance computing (HPC), scientific research, and environments requiring strong security.
Apptainer enables users to create, manage, and run containers that package applications with their dependencies in a portable, reproducible, and isolated manner.
It was originally known as [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) and is popular in academic and research institutions due to its focus on HPC environments.

## Relation to Singularity

Apptainer is the continuation of [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) under a new governance model.
In 2021, the Singularity project moved under the Linux Foundation, where it was rebranded as Apptainer to ensure the long-term sustainability and broader collaboration around the project.
Functionally, Apptainer continues Singularityâ€™s legacy, maintaining compatibility with its containers and focusing on the same core goals.

## Using Apptainer via wrapper repository

Please follow this link to the [repository](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_apptainer) container the Apptainer wrapper, configs and build scripts.

## Doing it yourself

Feel free to learn and master Apptainer yourself with the help of the official [documentation](https://apptainer.org/documentation/).
Your first apptainer image of the MRS UAV System can be built by bootstrapping from our docker image.
You can bootstrap from the latest _rolling_ version:
```
ctumrs/mrs_uav_system:latest
```
or from a particular version, e.g.,
```
ctumrs/mrs_uav_system:1.5.0
```
