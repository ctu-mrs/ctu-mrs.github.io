- Mix everything and keep the heat on high until the soup starts boiling.
- Turn the heat down, add a lid and boil for 15 minutes.
- Use a masher or a hand-held mixer and mash the peas to your preferred consistency.
- Dilute the soup. You can use water if you prefer a watery soup, but I would recommend using milk for a creamier result. You can even use cream for an extra creamy soup.

- Boil for additional 2 minutes after diluting.
