# Motor tests
All motor tests are done with a Turnigy MultiStar BLheli_32 51A ESC, with the 32.7 BLheli firmware. [ESC config](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/uav_core/blob/master/miscellaneous/blheli32_esc_config/T650/T650_M1.ini) is available in our repository. 
Current and voltage measurements are done by the ESC and thrust is measured with a 5 kg load cell, coupled with a HX711 amplifier.
Tests are done with fully charged lithium batteries, as we do not have a powerful enough adjustable power supply.
