# Disclaimers first

So, you decided that the simulations no longer cut it and you want to move into the real world? Excellent choice! But let's set some things straigt first.
- Even a relatively small F450 class drone is a very dangerous device. The propellers will cause a [very serious injury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch1SnP41tx0) if they hit you. Make sure to stay safe around your UAV. Always wear eye protection (pieces of propellers can hit you in the eye at any time), never approach the UAV while it flies and always follow the laws of you country.
- You need to have a capable safety pilot who can take over when the autonomous system fails. Never expect that the system will handle everything, it can and it will fail at some point. Always have at least two people when flying, one is a dedicated safety pilot and the other can handle the system.
- Take care of your lithium batteries. They will be a fire hazzard when handled improperly. Learn how to charge them, store them and use them safely. There is plenty of [resources](https://www.cnydrones.org/lipo-batteries-and-safety-for-beginners/#:~:text=A%20LiPo%20battery%20is%20designed,dangerous%20and%20eventually%20cause%20fire) online.
