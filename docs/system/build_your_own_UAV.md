# Build your own UAV

So, you decided that the simulations no longer cut it and you want to move into the real world? Excellent choice! But let's set some things straigt first.

## Disclaimers first

- **Even a relatively small F450 class drone is a very dangerous device.** The propellers will cause a [very serious injury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch1SnP41tx0) if they hit you. Make sure to stay safe around your UAV. Always wear eye protection (pieces of propellers can hit you in the eye at any time), never approach the UAV while it flies and always follow the laws of you country.
- **You need to have a capable safety pilot** who can take over when the autonomous system fails. Never expect that the system will handle everything, it can and it will fail at some point. Always have at least two people when flying, one is a dedicated safety pilot and the other can handle the system.
- **Take care of your lithium batteries.** They will be a fire hazzard when handled improperly. Learn how to charge them, store them and use them safely. There is plenty of [resources](https://www.cnydrones.org/lipo-batteries-and-safety-for-beginners/#:~:text=A%20LiPo%20battery%20is%20designed,dangerous%20and%20eventually%20cause%20fire) online.

## Learn how to fly a drone
If you do not have anyone who can act as a competent safety pilot, you have to learn how to fly your drone manually yourself. If you have flown some commercial drones, like the DJI Phantoms and Mavics, be aware that these are much easier to fly than a UAV that you are building. They will hold altitude and position for you automatically, making controlling them very easy. But you should be able to fly a drone in angle mode with manual throttle. Your drone will be able to hold altitude and position on its own too just with the pixhawk controller, but never rely on this. When something goes wrong, you need to be able to save your drone even if e.g. GPS fails.

The best way to learn how to fly is to get a cheap toy drone like the Syma X5. You can learn to fly competently in a few hours. Once you master this, you can move to you big drone and start practicing with it, until you are confident in the controlls..
