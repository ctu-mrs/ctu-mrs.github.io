# Resources
Crossroad for resources related to robotics and general research in the MRS group.
Includes links to courses, lectures, study materials, interesting blogs & podcasts, tips & tricks to academic writing, and many others.
Inspired by [**Awesome Mobile Robotics**](https://github.com/mathiasmantelli/awesome-mobile-robotics)[^1].

[^1]: Try to not include here resources available at [APR](https://github.com/mathiasmantelli/awesome-mobile-robotics) to avoid duplicities and improve clarity.
