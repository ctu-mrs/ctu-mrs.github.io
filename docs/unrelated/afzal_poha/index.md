# Afzal's Poha

Poha is a famous breakfast/snack from northern India.
It is simple to make and only requires a few ingredients.

## Ingredients

The quatities are for a serving of two meals for one person or just one meal if you like it as much as me :).

* 200g poha or rice flakes (Rýžové vločky) 
* 1 tomato
* 1 red onion
* 50 g of frozen peas
* 20 g peanuts
* vegetable oil or butter
* 2 cloves (hřebíček)
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin (kmín)
* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder (kurkuma)
* salt, according to taste
* pepper, according to taste
* chilli powder, according to taste
* 2-3 curry leaves (kari listy)

## Preparation

- The most critical step is to soak the rice flackes. Put the rice flakes in a large bowl like a salad bowl and pour water until all the flackes are submerged.
- Now, pour the water out, leaving the wet flackes inside the bowl. The rice flakes should not be in water for more than 5 seconds, so pour out the water instantly.
- Mix the flakes well with a spoon to avoid any lumps in the flakes and pour out any excess water.
- Leave the flakes to soak water while you prepare other ingredients.
