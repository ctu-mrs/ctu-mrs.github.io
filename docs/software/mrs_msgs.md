# MRS ROS messages

We keep all of our messages defined within a single package.
This is important for replay-ability of old rosbags, which requires a compiled definition of ROS messages from the time of the rosbag recording.
Keeping all messages within a single package makes this process significantly easier (and possible) comparing to defining them across the whole system.
