This package contains *high-level* flight managers.

### Notable quotes

* Quote #1: "The ControlManager is responsible for most of the crashes.", Dan Hert
* Quote #2: "It is better than humans at ensuring flight safety.", Tomas Baca
* Quote #3: "Was this supposed to happen?...", Martin Saska

## ControlManager

* integrates the control and tracking part of the MRS UAV pipeline
* dynamically loads [feedback controllers](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_controllers) and [reference trackers](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_trackers) plugins
* subscribes to the [UAV state estimate](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_odometry) and provides it to all loaded trackers and controllers
* runs the iteration of the currently active controller and tracker with every received state estimator message
* outputs the attitude rate command the [Mavros](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros)
* provides constraints to [trackers](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_trackers) through a common interface
* allows in-mid-air switching of [feedback controllers](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_controllers) and [reference trackers](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_trackers)
* provides common services for
  * setting a **reference**
  * setting a **trajectory reference**
  * human-callable **goto**, **goto relative**, **goto altitude**, **set heading** and **set relative heading**
  * **hover**
  * **emergency hover** after which most of the provided services are disabled
  * **emergency landing** - switches to emergency controller and tracker and lands as fast as possible
  * **failsafe landing** - feedforward landing, only effective in small heights and low speeds
  * **escalating failsafe** - the measures escalate when calling it repeatedly
    1. emergency landing
    2. failsafe landing
    2. disarm
  * transforming references and vectors between frames
  * verifying that references are inside of the allowed safety area
* provides safety routines for checking
  * position control error
  * tilt control error
  * yaw control error
  * estimator innovation error
  * missing estimator data
  * the validity of desired references
* allows controlling the UAV using a ROS-compatible joystick
* allows controlling the UAV using the **RC controller** through our pipeline
  * the RC channels are picked up from [Mavros](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros)
  * a relative reference is generated for the active tracker
  * **emergency landing** can be triggered by a dedicated switch
* provides an **obstacle bumper** feature
  * has priority over user-provided references
  * for slow-flight only
* **default cofig file**: [control_manager.yaml](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/cofig/default/control_manager.yaml)
* **launch file**: [control_manager.launch](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/launch/control_manager.launch)

## UavManager

* handles takeoff from the *high-level*
  * checks for pre-condition which might result in takeoff failure
  * switches to the right tracker and controller for the takeoff
  * triggers takeoff
  * switches to the right tracker and controller after the takeoff
* handles a regular landing from the *high-level*
  * descends to a landing height (~2.0 m) using the currently active tracker and controller, given the current constraints
  * switches to the right tracker and controller for the landing
  * triggers the landing
  * monitors the thrust output and decides when the UAV touched the ground
* provides a **land home** feature
  * the UAV flies in the current altitude to its **takeoff** location and lands
* provides a **land there** feature
  * the UAV flies to the desired position at which it lands
* monitors exceeding the **maximum altitude**
  * triggers a priority descend if it exceeds the safety area ceiling
* monitors exceeding the **maximum thrust**
  * triggers a landing if it exceeds a limit
* provides a **flight timer**
  * triggers a landing if it exceeds a limit
* **default cofig file**: [uav_manager.yaml](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/cofig/default/uav_manager.yaml)
* **launch file**: [uav_manager.launch](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/launch/uav_manager.launch)

## ConstraintManager

* stores and provides sets of dynamics constraints for the [trackers](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_trackers)
* allows mapping each set of constraints to only some state estimators of [mrs_uav_odometry](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_odometry)
* automatically switches to a fallback set of constraints if the current ones are not allowed
* provides a service for switching to a desired set of constraints
* only works when [mrs_uav_odometry](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_odometry) is used
* **default cofig files**: [constraints.yaml](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/cofig/default/constraint_manager/constraints.yaml), [constraint_manager.yaml](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/cofig/default/constraint_manager/constraint_manager.yaml)
* **launch file**: [constraint_manager.launch](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/launch/constraint_manager.launch)

## GainManager
* stores and provides sets of gains for the [So3Controller](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_controllers)
* allows mapping each set of gains to only some state estimators of [mrs_uav_odometry](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_odometry)
* automatically switches to a fallback set of gains if the current ones are not allowed
* provides a service for switching to a desired set of gains
* only works when [mrs_uav_odometry](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_odometry) is used
* **default cofig files**: [gains.yaml](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/cofig/default/gain_manager/gains.yaml), [gain_manager.yaml](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/cofig/default/gain_manager/gain_manager.yaml)
* **launch file**: [gain_manager.launch](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_managers/blob/master/launch/gain_manager.launch)
