##### Controlling the UAV through RVIZ  

Press the 'R' key to enter the "remote" mode. While in this mode, you can fly the UAV with your keyboard.
While in remote mode, press 'G' to switch to global frame.
Only one key at a time is registered, multiple key inputs are not supported.

|        Key       |        Action        |
|:----------------:|:--------------------:|
| 'wasd' or 'hjkl' |     Fly laterally    |
|       'qe'       | Change UAV's heading |
|       'rf'       |    Fly up and down   |

##### Custom services

You can add your own services to drone's menu.
 * To add a service to the menu, publish a message to the topic ```mrs_uav_status/set_trigger_service```
 * Only services of the [std_srvs/Trigger](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/std_srvs/html/srv/Trigger.html) type are supported
 * The message is a [std_msgs/String](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/std_msgs/html/msg/String.html), and has to consist of two entries separated by spaces:
   * Service name (```uav_manager/land_home```)
   * Name to be displayed in the menu (```Land Home```) - this name can contain additional spaces
 * The namespace of the UAV will be added automatically (```uav_manager/land_home``` -> ```/uav1/uav_managerland_home```)
 * To a service outside of the namespace, use "/" as the first character (```/uav_manager/land_home```)

Press the 'm' key (as menu) to show services on selected drones. Custom services will not be shown, only the default ones.

#### WaypointPlanner

Allows sending a sequence of waypoints to drone.
The click-and-pull input supplies a 2D position with heading (a waypoint). Tool properties allow customization (height change, fly now, loop, use heading).

|  Key  |         Action         |
|:-----:|:----------------------:|
|   w   | Turn the plugin on/off |
|  del  |  Delete last waypoint  |
