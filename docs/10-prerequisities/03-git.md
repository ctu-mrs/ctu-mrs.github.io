# Git

GIT is a distributed versioning control system.
All our code is stored and versioned using Git and hosted on [Gihub](https://github.com/ctu-mrs).
It allows collaborative work between many people and can be managed entirely from the terminal.

* Tutorials: [https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1), [https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial)
* Skills needed:
  * cloning repositories,
  * committing changes,
  * pushing and pulling changes to a server,
  * branching,
  * merging,
  * fixing merge conflicts (will come sooner or later).
