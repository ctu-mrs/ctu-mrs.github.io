title: Introduction
---

This documentation describes in detail the [MRS UAV System](https://github.com/ctu-mrs/mrs_uav_system) and
- how to install it,
- how to use it in simulation,
- what is the software architecture and how can you plug-in your algorithms, and
- how to setup your hardware for real-world compatibility.

Read carefully our manuals. If something is unclear, please ask at [ctu-mrs/discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ctu-mrs/discussions).

%% TODO: we should definitely include the basic oveerview of these concepts:
%% - overview images and key features
%% - licensing
%% - target audience
%% - quick start tutorial
%% - high-level architecture diagram and data flow
%% - list codebase, APIs and libraries
%% - how does our typical HW setup looks like and how to setup it
%% - basic operation
%% - where and how to ask for support/questions/troubleshooting
%% - references, resources
%% Most of this is inside the documentation itself, but a 5 minute read here must give the reader the basic functionality and context.
%% After reading this summary, the readers MUST know what it's for and how it can be used. Should be visual as much as possible, with the visuals being as straightforward as possible.
